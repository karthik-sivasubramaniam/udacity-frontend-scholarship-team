## Some basic rules to make it easy for everyone
* No frameworks. Just plain old HTML, CSS & JS working together in a project directory.
* HTML file should always be in the project's root directory, with CSS stylesheets and JS script files in their own sub-directories.
* Each project should have a single CSS stylesheet. We'll not be modularizing CSS, but you're welcome to organize the CSS rulesets into sections using comments.
* There's no timeline involved. If you find an open issue you'd like to work on, you're free to take it up and finish it at your own pace.
* Each challenge in its own project folder, so that this repo contains all challenges that the team is working on in one place.
